# Introduction to open data science

## A short description

Introduction to open data science is a course about the tools, methods and best practices of scientific research and I suppose research in general using data science and open sources. I expect to practice my skill in R and get to know how to use Github and R Markdown, which seem like valuable tools for this purpose.
