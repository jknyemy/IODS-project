## A short description

Introduction to open data science is a course about the tools, methods and best practices of scientific research and I suppose research in general using data science and open sources. I expect to practice my skill in R and get to know how to use Github and R Markdown, which seem like valuable tools for this purpose.

I decided to basically just copy the text I put into the README file, since I managed to misunderstand the instructions and long story short, I'm now content that this file, the index.html file and the README file are all extant and contain what they're supposed to contain.
